**In the scope of this project, there is a direct relationship of _1 to 1_ between Use Cases (UC) and User Stories (US).
**

However, be aware, this is a pedagogical simplification. On further projects and curricular units might also exist _1 to
N **and/or** N to 1 relationship between US and UC.

**For each UC/US, it must be provided evidences of applying main activities of the software development process (

link as suggested below.**
